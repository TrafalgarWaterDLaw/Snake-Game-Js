# Snake-Game-Js
Made with the P5 Library

My take on a snake game, with the snake being able to go through itself,
it is hilarious for me to play and I hope you enjoy it too...

## Specification

By default, the death feature is off although it can be enabled by uncommenting 
the over function within the snake class and uncommenting it in the sketch.js.

Enjoy :)
